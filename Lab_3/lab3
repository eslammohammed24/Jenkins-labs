what is the benefit of using master-slave architecture rather than building on master only ?\
- Produce backups — Obviously, the major utility of master-slave database architecture is its
ability to provide reliable backups through their chain of slave databases. The slave database
can be turned off without affecting the master database’s activities. This is because live data
snapshots will be replicated to the slave database, and data resources will remain intact
even if the master database fails.

- Scale out the application — When your number of users increases and your app’s usage
skyrockets, it’s critical to scale out your app so that your audience has a consistent
experience. By splitting your data load across numerous databases, the master-slave
database architecture can help you scale out your application.

- Split your work without causing a mess — You can use your slave nodes to collect the
necessary data and generate a complete report, while the master node pushes new updates
and features to your application server.

- Top-notch performance — It is extremely fast and fetches data without any issues, imposing
no restrictions regarding performance and time to load the data.


what is different between authorization and authentication ? 
  - Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service
  - Authorization determines their access rights
