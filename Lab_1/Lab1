01) What is Jenkins used for?
- Jenkins is used to build and test your product continuously, so          developers can continuously integrate
changes into the build.


02) What is Jenkins agent? What is Jenkins executor (Build Executor)?
 - Jenkins executor is one of the basic building blocks which allow a build to run on a node/agent (e.g., build server). Think of an executor as a single "process ID", or as the basic unit of resource that Jenkins
executes on your machine to run a build.

 - Jenkins agent is typically a machine, or container, which connects to a Jenkins controller and executes
tasks when directed by the controller

03) Explain Jenkins master-slave architecture?
   a) Jenkins Master
     Your main Jenkins server is the Master. The Master’s job is to handle:
            ▪ Scheduling build jobs.
            ▪ Dispatching builds to the slaves for the actual execution.
            ▪ Monitor the slaves (possibly taking them online and offline as required).
            ▪ Recording and presenting the build results.
            ▪ A Master instance of Jenkins can also execute build jobs directly.
            

   b) A Slave is a Java executable that runs on a remote machine. Following are the characteristics of Jenkins
     Slaves:
         • It hears requests from the Jenkins Master instance.
         • Slaves can run on a variety of operating systems.
         • The job of a Slave is to do as they are told to, which involves executing build jobs dispatched by the Master
         • You can configure a project to always run on a particular Slave machine or a particular type of Slave machine, or simply let Jenkins pick the next available Slave.
machine, or simply let Jenkins pick the next available Slave.
