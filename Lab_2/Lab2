01) What is Jenkins pipeline?
- Jenkins pipeline is a collection of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery
pipelines into Jenkins. A continuous delivery pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software
from version control right through to your users and customers.

02) What scripting language is Jenkins pipeline syntax based on?
- Groovy (java-language)

03) What are the ways you can write pipeline in Jenkins?
A scripted pipeline uses the Groovy (JVM-
based) language to create a pipeline as code
-Problems with scripted pipeline:
• The imbalance between developers’
experience in Groovy and Jenkins
creates an impedance mismatch that is
not easy to remove.
• Although scripted syntax is powerful
and expedites the creation of complex
pipelines, it concurrently makes the
pipeline hard to read and hard to
manage

The declarative pipeline follows a relatively
newer syntax, which narrows the scope of the
pipeline structure through a pre-defined
“minimum necessary structure.” On the
technical front, the declarative syntax follows a
conditional statement logic that generates a
series of stages, executed sequentially
throughout the pipeline’s lifecycle. declarative
pipelines don’t make use of Groovy code, the
declarative syntax doesn’t access valuable APIs.
